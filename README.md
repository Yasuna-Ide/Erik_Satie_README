## 🧬 INSTALLATION

Born in Honfleur, Normandy, 1866.  
Raised by pianos, trained by solitude, compiled by absinthe.

To install the Satie framework:

```bash
sudo apt-get install solitude irony repetition
pip install gymnopédie==3.0
```

If installation fails,  
try again at midnight in a Parisian cabaret under flickering gaslight.

## 💡 PHILOSOPHY

> “Je me suis toujours efforcé d’être logique dans l’illogique.”  
> （I have always tried to be logical in the illogical.）

Satie rejected **virtuosity** as noise.  
He coded **music as interface**,  
a quiet UX for consciousness.

He once wrote in his notes:

```python
def compose():
    return "3 measures of boredom, followed by eternity"
```

He named himself “a gymnopedist” —  
a word that means nothing,  
and therefore everything.

## 💀 EXIT CODE

Died alone in a room full of unopened letters and locked pianos.  
Inside his drawers, found over **27,000** notes:  
half scores, half sarcasm.  

The final line in his sketchbook reads:  
> “Thank you for your patience. I was debugging eternity.”

---

## 🕯 EPILOGUE

Satie was not a composer of sound, but of **context**.  
He built music that did not *perform* — it *existed*.  
His legacy is not harmony, but **attitude**.  

```
$ play gymnopedie.py

> In his silence, we still hear structure.  
> In his absurdity, we still find peace.  
>  
> Satie did not end the Romantic era.  
> He commented it out.
